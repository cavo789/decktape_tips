# Docker - Decktape

## Converting a reveal slideshow

The easy way to run Decktape with zero installation and zero configuration is to use the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/astefanutti/decktape).

If you don't have Docker yet, [please install it first](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Then, use the proposed `slides_pdf.cmd` DOS script to convert your slideshow to a PDF file; each slide will be also saved as a `.jpg` image in a `.slides_output` folder.

Too easy.
